    """
    return the list of all legal actions according to the input board.

    Args:
        - board: a 10Ã—9 chessboard matrix (a tuple of ten lists). You can use board[x][y] to retrieve 
            the content at column x and row y of the chessboard.
        - side: is a string ("red" or "black"), indicating which side you are querying.
        - history: records previous action sequences as a list. It is necessary because some illegal 
            actions are caused by history.

    Returns:
        - action_list : a list of actions, with each action being a four-element tuple. An action is 
            encoded as (old_x, old_y, new_x, new_y), which means moving board[old_x][old_y] to (new_x, new_y) 
            if legal and (possibly) eating the original piece at (new_x, new_y).
