        Variables:
            - self.side: specifies which side your agent takes. It must be "red" or "black".
            - self.history: records history actions.
            - self.move and self.move_back: when you do "search" or "rollout", you can utilize these two methods 
                to simulate the change of the board as the effect of actions and update self.history accordingly.
            - self.name : for you to set a name for your player. It is "Player" by default.

        Methods:
            - policy: the core method for you to implement. It must return a legal action according to the input 
                board configuration. Return values must be a four-element tuple or list in the form 
                of (old_x, old_y, new_x, new_y), with the x coordinate representing the column number 
                and the y coordinate representing the row number.
            - move: simulating movement, moving a piece from (old_x, old_y) to (new_x, new_y) 
                and eating a piece when overlap happens.
            - move_back: restoring the last move. You need to use it when backtracing along a path during a search,
                 so that both the board and self.history are reverted correctly.

        You should complement this method.

        Args:
            - board is a 10×9 matrix, showing current game state.
                board[i][j] > 0 means a red piece is on position (i,j)
                board[i][j] < 0 means a black piece is on position (i,j)
                board[i][j] = 0 means position (i,j) is empty.

        Returns:
            - Your return value is a four-element tuple (i,j,x,y), 
              which means your next action is to move your piece from (i,j) to (x,y).
            Note that your return value must be illegal. Otherwise you will lose the game directly.
