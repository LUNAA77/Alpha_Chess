def play_headless_game(red, black, timeout: bool = False):
    """
    Start a game using "red" and "black" agents with timeout.

    Args:
        - red, black: the two players, both are instances of the Player class. 
        - timeout: specifies whether the red or the black player. When timeout is set to true, a player that used out 
            its thinking time (10 seconds) will lose the game immediately. This is the setup we will use during the 
            final match. When timeout is set to false (default), it means there is no limitation on the thinking time, 
            which is useful for collecting learning data. This mode also has lower overhead due to the removal of 
            the timing thread.

    Returns:
        - winner: "red", "black" and "draw".
        - text: explainations of the result.
        - history: record of actions taken by both sides during the game.
